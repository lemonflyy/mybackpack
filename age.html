            I am young enough where I do not receive taxes. Unlike adults, I don’t have to worry about taxes. This brings me to my point where different civic issues will affect different age groups. Perhaps a civic issue is targeted towards senior citizens over toddlers.
            <br>
            For example, when people talk about lowering the houseing market, it’s targeted towards adults. Specifically, adults who are trying to buy houses.
            <br>
            Versus a topic such as the 2SLGTBQIA. This topic would be targeted more towards teens, as there’s more awareness on this topic in this age group. Civic issues are like a media’s target audience, they change by your age.
