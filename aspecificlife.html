            What is a specific life experience that shapes my opinion?
        </h1>
        <p>
            I clearly recall this specific life experience I read online. It was called the Sewol Ferry Tragedy.
            <br>
            This experience has made me realize how fragile every justice system truly is. The Sewol Ferry Tragedy was about a sinking ship, this ship took hundreds of lives down to a watery death with it.
            <br>
            Every first responder was just sitting by, not doing anything. Every singular person could’ve been saved if the captain had just issued the order to go up to deck.
            <br>
            The first responders would’ve had no excuse but to save them then. But no, the captain abandons ship and gets rescued leaving the rest to die.
            <br>
            This said captain, is givin 36 years in prison. That’s basically, one month in prison for every person who died.
            <br>
            <b>This experience has shaped my perspective on the law, more specifically, the law on criminal acts.</b>
