            What kind of manners have I been taught?
        </h1>

        <p>
            From a young age, I’ve been taught to always call my parents’ friends auntie or uncle when greeting them. It is seen as polite and a way to show respect to your elders.
            <br>
            You’re also expected to greet any other family members when you meet them. As a child, it’s impolite to talk back to a person in a generation above you.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a meal, it’s considered polite to say thank you to the person who made the meal. It’s a sign of appreciation and that the meal was well made.
            <br>
            Criticism is not welcome. It’s expected that you bring your dish to the sink so that someone can wash it.
            <br>
            hances are, if you ask for a specific thing to be made, you will be rejected. Only take the amount of food you are capable of finishing. Do not waste the food someone has prepared for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make a good impression, just do things with etiquette and politeness.
